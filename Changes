Revision history for Perl extension Text::Delimited.

2.00  2006/07/31

	Provided non-capitalized method names to match Perl style as suggested
         by CPAN rating comments. Historic "Java-style" method names still
	 function.

	Corrected POD and docs for new method names, version changes, other 
	 grammatical errors and removed accidental references to TabFile.pm

	Added initialization checks on exported methods to avoid superfluous
	 warnings generated when -w is used.

	Added credit to PetBlvd (http://www.petblvd.com) for the sponsorship
	 of further development.

1.93  2004/07/21

	Removed autovivification of the internal filehandle. Now using the
	 Symbol::gensym() to be backwards compatible to earlier versions
	 of Perl 5. Thanks to Shrinivas Potnuru for the bug report.

	Full copyright and license information.

1.91  2004/01/15
